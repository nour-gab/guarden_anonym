Dear admissions committee,

Teaching AP Physics at High School X is rewarding because of students like Abigail. I have had the joy of watching Abigail’s critical thinking skills and passion for science grow over the past four years in my AP Physics class and as captain of the High School X Robotics team. Abigail is one of the brightest and hardest working students I have had in all of my years of teaching, and it is truly an honor to recommend her for admission to your institution.

Abigail takes her position as captain of the Robotics team very seriously. I have seen her go above and beyond what is required of her to make new members feel welcome and ensure our team is prepared to do well during our competitions. I have never met a student with her level of dedication and passion for sciences, and I know she will be a strong addition to your school’s engineering program.

In addition to her academic strengths, Abigail also has strong leadership skills. She always takes initiative, tackles challenges head on, and serves as a role model for the other students on the team. I know her work ethic and leadership abilities will make a positive impact at your institution.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

Mr. Smith
